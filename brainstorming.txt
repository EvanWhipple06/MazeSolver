process:
1) store the maze in a 2d array
2) find a path to the exit
3) visually represent chosen path for debugging
4) profit?

finding the shortest path:
I could make it just take every single right turn because it goes clockwise for the checks and then when the whole path is found just cut every coordinate that repeats
and everything between the ones that repeat

1 correct path mazes completed

how to complete open ended mazes??
